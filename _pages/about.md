I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. I earned my bachelors (2019) and Master's (2021) degrees in political science from Georgia State University. Currently, I'm a PHD Candidate in public policy at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/).

I am an applied econometrician. I use methods such as difference-in-differences, synthetic controls, matching, regression discontinuity, and others to infer the impacts of policies/interventions for economics, policy analysis, and other fields. Check out my under-development "**mlsynth**" [Python](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) code for causal inference. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to Statalist.
