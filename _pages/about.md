I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. I'm a PHD Candidate at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/). I'm a public policy student. I work in econometrics, causal inference, and statistics (check out my under-development "Machine Learning Synthetic Control" [Python](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) code for causal impact estimation). I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to Statalist.
