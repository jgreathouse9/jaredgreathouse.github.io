I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. I earned my bachelors (2019) and Master's (2021) degrees in political science from Georgia State University. Currently, I'm a PHD Candidate in public policy at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/).

I am an econometrician. I specialize in treatment effect estimation for fields like economics, political science, policy, marketing, and other fields.

Check out my under-development "**mlsynth**" [Python](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) code. It implements various artificial counterfactual estimators in a user friendly, streamlined manner. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to the Statalist forum.
