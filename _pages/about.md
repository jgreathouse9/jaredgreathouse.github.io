HiðŸ˜Š I'm Jared Amani Greathouse. I earned my B.A and M.A. (2019, 2021) in political science from Georgia State University. Currently, I'm a PHD Candidate in public policy at Georgia State and the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jason Coupet](https://aysps.gsu.edu/profile/jason-coupet/).

I am an econometrician who specializes in treatment effect estimation, particularly with (but not limited to) synthetic controls and difference-in-differences.

Check out my under-development "**mlsynth**" [Python](https://github.com/jgreathouse9/mlsynth) code. It implements various artificial counterfactual estimators in a user friendly, streamlined manner. I am [also](https://www.statalist.org/forums/member/51320-jared-greathouse) an active contributor to the Statalist forum. [Here's my vita](http://jgreathouse9.github.io/files/VitaWeb.pdf). If you'd like to talk with me about my work, my consulting services, or anything else that's of interest, you may always reach out to me!
