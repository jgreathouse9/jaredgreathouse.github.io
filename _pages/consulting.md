<h1>Program Evaluation</h1>

Frequently, researchers need to know if some intervention (say, a tax, an anti-tobacco policy, an abortion ban, or some new marketing idea) had some effect on outcomes that we (policymakers, the public, etc.) care about. However, policy is never self justifying; it must be studied and evaluated to see if it actually achieves the aims it is meant to achieve. The gold standard to do this is typically conducting a randomized controlled trial, where we assign, at random, some units to receive a treatment and others not. However, this is rarely possible in real life for a host of reasons. Absent randomized trials we know that simple regression analysis, even when we control for a host of covariates, is rarely good causal evidence.

Instead, this demands skilled and judicious use of domain expertise and modern econometrics that can more appropriately adjust for confounders so as to yield an unbiased treatment effect. \\(y=mx+b\\)
